In the spring of 2017 I took a data visualization course. Using d3, I created an exploratory map-based visualization of commercial passenger flight delays in the continental U.S. during one month. After selecting one commercial aircraft, the routes that aircraft flew over the course of the month are drawn on the map in chronological order and colored by how long that flight was delayed.
