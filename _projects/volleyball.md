For my senior comprehensive exercise, I worked with a team of 4 other students and the varsity women's volleyball coach to create an iPad app for volleyball coaches. Designed to replace a traditionally paper-based process, the app allows coaches to chart where on the court players make hits to. Then, during a timeout in the game, coaches can visualize those hits and make side-by-side comparisons between different players, rotations, and sets.

The app is still in active development, and we recently released it on the App Store. Check it out!
