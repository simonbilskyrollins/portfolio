I recently graduated from Carleton College with a degree in computer science. I have experience with both web development and iOS development, but I'm always looking for new technologies to learn and interesting problems to solve. When I'm not writing code you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, solving crosswords (early in the week, that is), poring over baseball stats, or [geocaching](https://geocaching.com).

Take a look at my [resume](assets/docs/resume.pdf), browse through the [projects](#projects) I've worked on, and feel free to [contact me](#contact) at any time.
